## **Description**
The purpose of this assignment add a backend to a functional workout tracker.  WE had to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema as well as handle routes with Express.  The user should be able to input the various workouts they have completed and then see a visual represnetation of the previous seven workouts.  

What I think helped me greatly was taking the time to review the given code before I actually started to fill in the gaps.  Even though we didn't really use or have to worry about the documents too much. I found it much more helpful to know exactly what the app does (or in this case, should do) before going in to fix it.
